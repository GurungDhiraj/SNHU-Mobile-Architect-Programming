## <ins>**Project Description:**<ins>
The goal of this app was to create an inventory management app that had a few key features, like adding, updating, and deleting items in the inventory. There also had to be a focus on making the user interface (UI) easy to navigate. The intention was to create an app that multiple users could use, and it should be able to save all of their data to their accounts as well. To accommodate such needs, having a login page and an inventory page was crucial. There are no extra features in the app as of now because the main goal was to ensure that the user's needs were met. The navigation for the UI is quite simple to understand as well. Since the main page is the inventory page, every other page will lead back to the inventory page when you go back using the built-in Android features. There is a back button on the header for the navigation as well.

When creating this app, I first started with the user needs, then designed what the pages would look like, next I planned what pages I wanted, and the last part of the process was the coding and testing of the code. I coded in increments and tested the code in increments as well to ensure everything was functioning as intended. There were times I needed to do a lot of research on how to make the code work, particularly when I wanted the app to update the information without reloading the app. I think it was when coding this particular bit of code that my experience with coding came in handy. This is because coding this was very difficult for me, and it took a lot of time; however, I did not lose all hope. I was able to persevere and find a solution because I had been through similar experiences before.
